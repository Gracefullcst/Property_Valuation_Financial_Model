# Property Valuation Financial Model and Analysis

## Overview
A financial valuation and comparative investment analysis for two real estate assets power by a custom-built financial model, successfully identifying the more profitable asset, and enabling data-driven investment decisions by applying key metrics like Return on Investment (ROI), Present Value (PV), Net Present Value (NPV), Future Value (FV), benchmark rate, and Internal Rate of Return (IRR).

This analysis incorporated best-practice investment appraisal techniques and demonstrates financial modeling proficiency using Excel.
The insights from this analysis informed the investment decisions of InvEstate, a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT).

## Dataset
- Source: Financial Statement for Gozie Building (Previous Year)
- Format: .xlsx


## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel – for all modeling, calculations, and scenario testing
- Financial functions: PV, FV, NPV, XNPV, IRR, XIRR
- Excel-based Financial Modeling – to structure investment scenarios and evaluate performance metrics
- Modeling Techniques: Dynamic cash flow modeling, what-if analysis, and return comparisons


## Analytical Workflow
1. Data Preparation
  - Cleaned and structured the financial input data from source statements.
  - Organized cash flows by period, separated capex from operational inflows, and accounted for recurring revenue and expenses.

2. Assumptions & Scenario Setup
  - Defined key model assumptions:
    - Investment horizon
    - Target acquisition and exit capitalization rates
    - Starting rent (after acquisition and renovation) and annual rent growth rate
    - Benchmark discount rate and reinvestment rate
    - Cost growth rate and inflation expectations
    - Projected Net Operating Income and property value based on holding period
  - Modeled both properties under the same baseline to allow fair comparison.

3. Core Financial Calculations
  - Present Value (PV) and Future Value (FV): Calculated to assess the time value of cash inflows and outflows.
  - Net Present Value (NPV): Measured overall profitability, considering the cost of capital.
  - Internal Rate of Return (IRR): Assessed investment efficiency and compared returns to the benchmark rate.
  - Payback Period: Evaluated liquidity and risk exposure by estimating the time to recover initial investment.

4. Comparative Analysis
  - Built a side-by-side comparison dashboard showcasing ROI, NPV, IRR, and Payback Period across both assets.
  - Evaluated the risk-return tradeoff, considering capital intensity, cash flow consistency, and volatility.

5. Sensitivity & Scenario Testing
  - Simulated changes in interest rate, rental income, and maintenance cost to observe impacts on NPV and IRR.
  - Supported InvEstate in understanding downside risk and identifying breakeven points.


## Key Insights
1. ROI Comparison: 
Gozie Building offered a projected ROI of 281.50%, while the other property projected 92.64%, making the former the more attractive option based on return potential.

2. Net Present Value (NPV) Difference: 
The NPV of Investment A was ₦564,905, compared to ₦238,550 for the other property, indicating a stronger present value performance from Gozie Building.

3. Internal Rate of Return (IRR) Assessment: 
Gozie Building had an IRR of 16.65%,  while the other had an IRR of 16.53%. Since both IRRs exceed the discount rate of 16.5%, both are viable, but Gozie Building yields a better return relative to the cost of capital.

4. Payback Period Analysis: 
Gozie Building achieves payback in 2 years, whereas the other property requires 3 years, suggesting a faster capital recovery with the former.

5. Risk vs. Return Tradeoff: 
Although Gozie Building had a higher return, it came with increased risk due to higher capital requirements. This tradeoff was carefully weighed against InvEstate’s risk appetite and long-term goals.


## Final Investment Recommendation
After a detailed financial modeling and comparative investment analysis, Gozie Building was recommended as the superior investment for InvEstate. It delivered a significantly higher ROI of 281.50%, NPV of ₦564,905, and a slightly better IRR of 16.65%, all outperforming the alternative property. Additionally, it offered a faster payback period of 2 years, enhancing capital recovery. While it required a larger upfront investment, the stronger returns and faster profitability aligned well with InvEstate’s goals, making it the more strategic and data-backed choice.
