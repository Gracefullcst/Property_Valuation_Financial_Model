# Property Valuation Financial Model and Analysis

## Overview
This project presents a financial analysis of two mutually exclusive real estate investments to determine the more viable option based on potential Return on Investment (ROI). Key financial metrics such as Present Value (PV), Net Present Value (NPV), and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) were considered.

The insights from this analysis informed the investment decisions of InvEstate, a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT).

## Dataset
- Source: Financial Statement of Gozie Building for the Previous Year
- Format: .xlsx

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel – for data analysis.
  - Special functions: PV, FV, NPV, XNPV, IRR, and XIRR
- Excel-based Financial Modeling – to structure investment scenarios and evaluate performance metrics

## Key Insights
1. ROI Comparison
Gozie Building offered a projected ROI of 281.50%, while the other property projected 92.64%, making the former the more attractive option based on return potential.

2. Net Present Value (NPV) Difference
The NPV of Investment A was ₦564,905, compared to ₦238,550 for the other property, indicating a stronger present value performance from Gozie Building.

3. Internal Rate of Return (IRR) Assessment
Gozie Building had an IRR of 16.65%,  while the other had an IRR of 16.53%. Since both IRRs exceed the discount rate of 16.5%, both are viable, but Gozie Building yields a better return relative to the cost of capital.

4. Payback Period Analysis
Gozie Building achieves payback in 2 years, whereas the other property requires 3 years, suggesting a faster capital recovery with the former.

5. Risk vs. Return Tradeoff
Although Gozie Building had a higher return, it came with increased risk due to higher capital requirements. This tradeoff was carefully weighed against InvEstate’s risk appetite and long-term goals.
