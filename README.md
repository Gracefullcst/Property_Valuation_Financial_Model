# Property Valuation Financial Model

## Overview
This project presents a financial analysis of two mutually exclusive real estate investments to determine the more viable option based on potential Return on Investment (ROI). Key financial metrics such as Present Value (PV), Net Present Value (NPV), and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) were considered.

The insights from this analysis informed the investment decisions of InvEstate, a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT).

## Dataset
- Source: Gozie Building Financial Statement for the Previous Year
- Format: Excel

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel – for data analysis. Utilized functions: PV, FV, NPV, XNPV, IRR, and XIRR
- Excel-based Financial Modeling – to structure investment scenarios and evaluate performance metrics

## Key Insights
- ROI Comparison: Gozie Building offered a projected ROI of 281.50%, while the other property projected 92.64%, making the former the more attractive option based on return potential.

Net Present Value (NPV) Difference: The NPV of Investment A was ₦564,905, compared to ₦238,550 for the other property, indicating a stronger present value performance from Gozie Building.

Internal Rate of Return (IRR) Assessment: Gozie Building had an IRR of 16.65%,  while the other had an IRR of 16.53%. Since both IRRs exceed the discount rate of 16.5%, both are viable, but Gozie Building yields a better return relative to cost of capital.

Payback Period Analysis: Gozie Building achieves payback in 2 years, whereas the other property requires 3 years, suggesting a faster capital recovery with the former.

Risk vs. Return Tradeoff
Although Gozie Building had a higher return, it came with increased risk due to higher capital requirement. This tradeoff was carefully weighed against InvEstate’s risk appetite and long-term goals.
